function el = export_referenced_frame_of_reference_sequence(args)
%Subfunction to handle referenced_frame_of_reference sequences within the
%structure_set module.  Uses the same layout and principle as the parent
%function.
%
%   This function takes a list of CERR scans (or scan UIDs if available)
%   and as data to have UIDs created for them.
